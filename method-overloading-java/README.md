# Method Overloading

Here we Implemented Method Overloading in Java.

In this, we have taken one class named 'Greetings' which contains the method name Greet.

This Greet method is written two times, the first is a string as a parameter, and the second is an array of strings as a parameter.

By writing two methods with diffrent parameters we archive the method overloading.
