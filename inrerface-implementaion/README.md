# Interface Implementation

Here we created an example to understand the Interface.

In this, we implemented One Interface and Two Classes as follows

- Animal (Interface)  
    This is an interface that has two methods constructor & 'sound()' any class which implements this interface needs to implement this abstract method.

- Dog (Class)
    this class implements the Animal interface and implemented the constructor and 'sound()' method as per the requirements

- Cat (Class)
    this class extends the Animal class and implemented the 'sound()' method as per the requirements
