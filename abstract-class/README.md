# Abstract Class

Here we created an example to understand Abstract classes.

In this, we implemented three classes as follows

- Animal    
    This is an abstract class that has to attribute $name and one abstract method named 'sound()' any class which extends this class needs to implement this abstract method.

- Dog
    this class extends the Animal class and implemented the 'sound()' method as per the requirements

- Cat
    this class extends the Animal class and implemented the 'sound()' method as per the requirements
