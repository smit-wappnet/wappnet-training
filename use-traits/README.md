# Use Traits

Here we Implement a PHP program in which we are going to use traits

For the implementation of traits, we have defined one trait 'Animal' using the Trait keyword,

and simply use the 'use' keyword in the class body where we want to use it.

Implementation is done as follows:

- Animal (traits)
    This is an animal trait that contains two attributes and one method 'sound()'.

- Dog (class)
    This is a Dog class which use the Animal traits.

- Cat (class)
    This is the Cat class which use the Animal trait.
